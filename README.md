# EPA Source Apportionment Project

UGA Statistics client capstone project to perform source apportionment on air quality data, identifying pollution sources and quantifying their contributions

## Project Description

This project aims to perform **source apportionment** on air pollutant data collected from sensors in three U.S. cities. The core task is to mathematically disentangle the mixture of pollutants measured at each location to understand their individual sources.


(This is based on the notes I took from the presentation)

The primary goals are to produce two key outputs:

1. **Source Profiles**: The chemical "fingerprint" or signature of each distinct pollution source.

2. **Source Contributions**: A possible time-series analysis showing how much each source contributed to the pollutants measured in each air sample.

## Research Objectives

- Build a source apportionment model to calculate source profiles and contributions.

- Evaluate the model's performance using cross-validation and other relevant metrics.

- Investigate how incorporating measurement uncertainty into the data impacts the model's results.

## Datasets

he analysis will be performed on three real-world datasets from:

- Baton Rouge

- St. Louis

- Baltimore.
